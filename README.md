- The Cookie Client is the scrpit Python, this is the script that you have to use for controlling the victim machine;

You can use it on your mobile phone (use QPython) or in your computers. You have to set only the IP of the victim, it have to be in your LAN or you have to use __Cookie__ with a __Backdoor__. The default port i [7373]

- The Cookie Server is the C# service; You have to change the IP and the default port:
